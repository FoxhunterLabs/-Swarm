🐝 Swarm

Deterministic Multi-Agent Coordination Framework
A human-gated synchronization layer extending Foxhunter’s architecture for real-world, auditable multi-agent autonomy.

🎯 Overview

Swarm enables deterministic, explainable coordination across multiple autonomous nodes.
Each agent operates under bounded logic, verified decision paths, and explicit human approval — ensuring reliability, traceability, and total control at scale.

Swarm builds directly on the Foxhunter Pro stack, using the same ethical-autonomy core and SHA-256 audit infrastructure to synchronize movements, decisions, and telemetry between agents with zero black-box behavior.

⚙️ Core Features

Multi-Agent Synchronization Layer — deterministic timing and state propagation across all nodes.

Human-Gated Coordination — every collective action requires human confirmation.

Trustworthy Autonomy Protocol (TAP) — ensures synchronized audits between agents for cross-verification.

Dynamic Role Assignment — designates scout, relay, and executor nodes at runtime.

Resilient Mesh Communication — local-first peer-to-peer coordination with failover recovery.
